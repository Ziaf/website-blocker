 I use this particular program every

single day for my personal use and I wouldn't go as far as to say this has changed my life but I can

certainly say that this program has multiplied my work productivity.

There's no magic there.

It's a simple python program yet tricky that runs on the background and all it does is it doesn't

let you browse certain distracting websites such as Facebook or your e-mail account during your working hours.

The program is tested to work on Windows, Mac and Linux.

The idea is that once you build this program you pass to the program website links that you think

are distracting.

So you pass links as strings and the time that you are working on your computer and the program will

block these websites during these working hours.

And in that way you not only are much more productive but this also reduces stress as distraction is also known

to cause stress. If you don't have anny problem with the distractions like I do you probably won't need

this program.
